    "    - Used for representing real numbers.\n",
    "    - Example: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`\n",
    "    - **Warning**: Not every real number can be represented as a floating point number. For example, we can only approximate $\\pi$ up to a certain number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Numbers (complex)**:\n",
    "    - Numbers with a real and an imaginary part.\n",
    "    - Represented as `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.\n",
    "    - Example: `3 + 4j`, `-2 + 0.5j`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Booleans (bool)**:\n",
    "    - Represents truth values: `True` or `False`.\n",
